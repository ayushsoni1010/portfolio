## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with Portfoliogram, follow the installation instructions in the project's documentation.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ayushsoni1010/portfolio.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
cd portfolio
npm install
```

3. Configure the environment variables, including API keys and settings.

4. Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. First, run the development server and access the portfolio in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

6. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

7. [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

8. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More 💡

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel 🔗

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
